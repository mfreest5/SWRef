                How should one describe themselves? <br><br> Does one simply blurt out their accomplishments, like how escaped empire sanctioned priviteers by tricking them into attacking eachother? <br> or perhaps explain their runins with the empire inquisitors and how one never encounters them and leaves the same. <br> or does one simply provide their name, one with which happens to be well known such as Kalif 'The Marked'.
                <br>
                By the way have i told you how i came to have this mark?
                <br><br>
                Not that it matters much, i have access to this knowledge and knowledge should be free. After all it may come in handy to you...
